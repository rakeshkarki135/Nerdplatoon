After looking around Scarborough and the east end of the city..I realized this was the best PRICE..not only that it was a clean location. lots of options for storage and the Staff are very friendly and helpful..I would recommend this location..my only complaint was the lack of lighting in each storage unit ..but I understand why this is not a option..it's a good storage cheaper than all the REST..you won't be disappointed..👌,2024-04-14 20:42:14,5,google,XKybmx05@gmail.com,Al Neno,scarborough

I have never used a storage unit before but the wonderful people at xyz etobicoke were some of the best customer service I have ever been supported by. They were able to switch me to a larger unit with 1hr notice. They were helpful in showing me a great unit and how to use the facility.  They gave me zero hassles throughout the whole process. Would absolutely rent from them again,2024-12-10 23:31:50,5,google,THhysh38@gmail.com,L b,etobicoke

"Rented a storage unit years ago - XYZ is NOTHING like that
Clean modern local convenient - the desk staff were great - Kayla and Eyshanna - in the middle of a move for staging - storage - move to actually move - their clam and friendly presence was greatly appreciated
I like the flexible terms being able to move out mid month and get a rebate - that's great service
We used Laird - great loading docks for the big truck and drive into the building for smaller stuff
I think I would rate this company and it's methods and practice as 110%
Not that I want to move again LOL -  but if I do they will be at the top of the list !
Thanks XYZ",2024-12-10 19:23:18,5,google,LVauma08@gmail.com,George Dark,toronto-midtown

"My wife and I were considering a few storage facilities; comparing rates, proximity and ease of access. We went to XYZ first where Sheila showed us around, taking time to explain the various options and what might be best for us. The place was clean and to our liking and Sheila really impressed us so we decided to go with XYZ without bothering to look at other facilities. When I first went to move things into storage I met Lela who, after sharing a good laugh with another staff member, helped me move in.
Both ladies were super friendly, cheerful and helpful and not at all what I expected in a storage facility.",2024-12-03 23:16:22,5,google,RXgybs73@gmail.com,mike pietkiewicz,toronto-west

"5star rating from beginning to end the whole experience is easy-peasy. I have rented the unit for short term here the units are easy to find, cleaned up and you dont need to provide them a key as i heard from other reviews. I like the prorated process so you wont end up loosing money for unused days as the billing cycle is monthly. They do have good rates compartively.24*7 access to your unti but after hours access require a request that you can make in the office which is open and will recieve confirmation in mins-didnt try on my end so can't review how long it took for access during after hours.",2024-11-23 15:12:46,5,google,BMsvdo97@gmail.com,srikar avinash,scarborough

Hi Annissa,
On my comments prior to this , a person called Harshan replied and even I emailed him. But so far no reply. That mail has all the details about the exact storage I am talking about. Further i tried the number he gave, it’s not reachable. So why don’t you guys look in to it and least reply my mail if your showing the least concern about your customer.
harshan.g@xyzstorage.com
This is the mail I wrote to.
Anyway I will try to call again.

My husband’s storage got just sold off even when his last respond was that he will come to pay it off. Just 10 days after that they sold it without waiting. Did we at any point say we are not paying? When we went there to pay the manager was so unfriendly as if we took money personally from her or owe her personally anything. She said we abandoned it? How funny, if we abandoned, would we say that we are coming to pay and what is the right the company has to sell off this just in 10 days after responding..? All our personal belongings were in it and the sad thing is my 6 year old’s clothing were in it too.. so not good to do anything with, worst storage experience in 6 years.. they have no patience as a company and just wants money money and money. Does not know the value of what people put inside their storages. I think its kind of their business to sell these off at the slightest miss..

"** There is absolutely no use of writing to these people. Why do you even bother replying the reviews when you don’t simply get back on the issue. I think selling off the goods of other people are a part of your business. Beware.. Stay away from this storage.. There are so many other friendly and economical places..

** Responded on email. Hope you will give a solution for this. This is the worst ever experience in Canada we ever had in the 6 years. Just to be clear, we had all our winter clothes in there and that includes my 6 year old daughter. How can you just do it to a person who was in contact in mid-August and telling you that he will pay. You can’t just take this kind of action without even waiting for 2 weeks. Is this some kind of trick yoy do to your customers?

We had a really bad experience. All our goods, my husband’s construction tools and our personal clothes shipped from home country had been on auction. They said they have been contacting, my husband however at one instance that he will pay by 2nd September, they have it as 22nd August. We came here to pay today, boom, the goods auctioned., They have there text message history saying this and that. However the person is office said they thought we abandoned the place . That’s like a joke as some calls in August came through and my husband has called.
So if you are a busy person, not too much in to your mails, XYZ is a really bad place.
Funny part is they have there call logs only for there favor. The one my husband mentioned as coming by 2nd September is gone missing. So be careful to always deal in written form with these guys.",2024-09-01 16:00:05,1,google,WXcdxr61@gmail.com,Rumeeshi De Silva,scarborough

"POORLY MANAGED FINANCIALLY, UNETHICAL. Raised their prices almost 50% from when I first rented. That’s about $200 total over the past year for a storage originally signed at $570 (including taxes), now it’s at a whopping 750. Total SCAM DO NOT RECOMMEND. They’re Suggesting reduce my unit Size to afford their various increases - Hiring movers to move furniture would cost me $1000 min. Moving it to a smaller unit, Only to see it increase again without much warning or price protection. Government limits home rentals to percentage price increases per year (2.5% this year). This would be a great idea for a Storage rental company So that they are not putting their customers in difficult positions. At this point, why would I pay a mover To use the same facility again? I’m now in search for a new Storage facility as I’m seeing no other way. Save yourself a trouble do not commit to this company. You never know where your situation is going to be-  in my case I did not anticipate to be using the storage facility from almost a year. But this has really open my eyes To the fact that they do not abide by the original contract prices.",2024-09-30 09:53:05,2,google,BSflor86@gmail.com,Stephanie Chow,toronto-downtown

"I like the facility and the staff. Those were positives. However I was a long time customer (4years?) having started with a 100sq.ft unit and then downsizing to half that as costs went up big. I did not even look elsewhere until recently and found that I was charged more than double a competitor’s regular price and I was paying a good premium to XYZ’s new customer regular price. Look, I liked the facility and should have looked harder at my invoices, but the pricing behaviour is absolutely predatory. Take any promo’s for short term rentals and then run. Not worth storing anything there longer term. I asked for a review of my rates comparing to their pricing and competitors and they just said they wouldn’t increase my rates. You’re better off being the squeaky wheel with these guys and hammer for every penny. That’s just not how Ido business.",2024-10-24 14:56:52,1,google,BVbovh48@gmail.com,Rick Henshaw,toronto-west

"I had the greatest experience ever with Tino and Doreen at this location. The 1st day meeting them both I was made feel that I was their #1 customer and not only a customer, but a friend.  Professional, helpful, considerate, dependable, honest to the bone. The unit was spotless inside, warm over the winter so my things came out the way they went in.  Very safe and secure place, extremely well ran.  Only leaving as I'm leaving the country.  I had a 40' container there for 3 hours today and if need be could have been longer, Tino was so thoughtful allowing me the time to get things packed properly for the ship.
I highly recommend this company especially this location, where ye will be well looked after and will be delighted with their service.  ""Slainte"", my friends

Carl’s friendly demeanor and willingness to go above and beyond were evident throughout our interactions.

"Was hung up on by their customer service representative after I was not allowed entry to my unit for a ""late exit violation"" that is not explained anywhere on their website or is my lease. Also they advertise 24 hour access everywhere on their website but you are only allowed in from 9-7

Spent 5 hours with customer service only to be told by the operating manager that they can't be expected to update the lease agreement everytime they make changes.

"Disappointing sales tactics. I helped my friend pick up a vintage camper. She is going away for a long term trip and needed to store if for a few months.

She called in and was told that a parking spot for her 14ft trailer was $175. The next day we drove from Leslieville to the facility.

It turned out the quoted $175 was a 50% off special and thereafter it is $350 per month. This was  straight bait and switch on the call and wasted our time.

I was going to store my RV there and we were considering also splitting 20 x something unit.

Well $700 a month to store two small things outside is crazy. And the bait and switch is a dirty tactic.

"Amazing experience using XYZ storage at the Etobicoke location. With an hour or less before close we were able to get a unit and move in quickly (on a Friday evening at that).

The team here is fantastic — special shoutout to Carl, Melissa, and Jessica who really saved the day for us and went above and beyond in helping us have a smooth move in. These three really need to be commended for their customer service and will never be forgotten as they made sure we ended up on the positive side of a make or break situation.

The pricing for the space you get is very value for indoor storage type facilities. Move in and outs are straightforward as there are multiple loading docks you can back your vehicle/truck against to expedite the process.

I also asked the staff member moving me in if the unit was accessible 24/7. I was told yes but when I came back on a later date to access the unit, I couldn't get in. Later found out, I had to request 24-hour access (it's on a case by case basis whatever that means?) but was confused why the staff member didn't say that when I asked.

"TERRIBLE EXPERIENCE!!!
I was with them for around 6 months in F0999 and when we moved out, a number of my boxes had rodent poop. The facility is not secure at all as rodents roam around freely chewing on stored goods. We lost several winter blankets and jackets to the rodent infestation. I wish they had been honest about the issue in hand at the time we signed up.
Not recommended at all if you want your goods to be safe.
Latest update: One of the representatives contacted me and asked for photos of the blankets in exchange for some compensation!! I don’t know anyone who keeps pictures of people sleeping tucked in blankets.

Staff are amazing - especially Tino! Reason for 4 star review is the fact that their auto-generated increases after only a few months - they gotta stop!!

"Tino is the man. He made our entire process renting a storage unit at XYZ Storage Scarborough extremely pleasant. Among other things he gave us extended access to our unit after hours twice in the first week when he knew we were bringing Jessica’s belongings. He was friendly, accommodating, and helpful. He even left a way for us to find our locker when we returned the first time. Always smiling, positive and upbeat. You can tell he likes helping people, and a company with the foresight to hire him has my loyalty. Big fan. A bright spot in otherwise perilous times.

"the computer system this company uses is criminal for creating arbitrary surge prices and unit pricing for customers. Over the course of my tenancy, I have noticed inconsistencies in unexplained rent increases. On one occasion, I found myself paying more for a smaller unit compared to a larger one, which seems illogical and unfair.

These billing discrepancies have left me feeling dissatisfied, and it appears that company may not be serving the best interests of loyal, existing customers. I believe that maintaining customer satisfaction is crucial for the long-term success of any business.

Despite these challenges, I want to emphasize that your employee, Jordan, at the Eastern Ave location, has always given me exceptional service that has been a bright spot in my experience with your company. Her understanding and responsiveness to my complaints have made a significant positive impact, and I believe she deserves recognition for her efforts. I suggest a well-deserved vacation and a raise. I'm sure the hefty contributions from the ""innovative"" billing system can cover that without any issues. I believe that such gestures can go a long way in fostering a positive workplace culture and customer relations.

I hope this company and its founders John Donald and Hal Spradling,  will consider improvements to the billing system to ensure a fair and transparent experience for all customers.

The entire purpose of a storage facility is to create a safe and secure place for individuals to store their belongings. However, maintaining a sense of safety and security becomes challenging when monthly rent hikes occur seemingly at random. This situation creates an unsettling atmosphere, giving the impression of a forced eviction through pricing individuals out of the facility.",2024-01-17 23:21:22,1,google,BXbfbe30@gmail.com,Lovina,toronto-downtown

"My experience started with All Canadian Self Storage now XYZ Storage. I request that certain items be purchased back to me or return in order to prevent any court action or willing immediately return my unit, all personal property, papers, photos, legal documents, tax returns, bank statements, etc. to the Storage location for return to me from May 31st auction.

My complaint is against XYZ Storage when they stopped working with me to save my storage after a few missed payments due to price increases from multiple renovations. They auctioned my storage unit yesterday. The manager, Doraine said I could bid for my own unit.

I explained to the auction company that my brother, in the name of Jesus, asked me to place a bid of $500 minimum first and within 5 minutes, I submitted a $10 bid in error that totalled $510 under Buyer username. The site isn't user-friendly for first-timers. When he needed assistance from the auction company's customer service, the female representative asked ""why are you bidding so high."" He mentioned on May 31st that he has a cellphone, not a Smartphone and $500 is the minimum.

The auction closed on May 31st. The auction company stated the notification email was sent immediately after the auction closed on May 31st to notify the winner. He mentioned that he didn't receive the email on May 31st as promised. The customer service representative insisted it was sent. Instead, the female sent the email on June 1st at 8:39am stated ""According to our records, you are not the winner of unit."" The person with the Buyer username won the unit."" The auction representative made an error to send the notification email on June 1st.

After many attempts trying to rectify the misunderstanding that I am the Buyer username not someone else. They challenged me. As the tenant, I want my unit back. I explained that he bid the minimum and the $10 bid under the Buyer username. They insisted that I don't have an account set up. I mentioned the Buyer username doesn't have one either. The customer service staff accused me of lying about winning the auction, blaming me, and refusing to listen to me. The auction customer service lied to me by convincing me the auction was won by another bidder. Not true. False facts. Therefore, I have not received a confirmation email that I won the bid. The customer service representative stated, ""Our communication via email ends here.""

I tried to communicate with XYZ Storage manager and the auction company to fix things. Both companies refuse to comprehend, listen and meet me halfway. Instead, they were disrespectful, dishonest, and unfair. I am not happy with yesterday's outcome nor thankful to XYZ Storage and the auction company for their work and expertise.

As a matter of fact, XYZ Storage is not the best storage company in Toronto. I'm disappointed in how I was treated after the auction. The manager, Doraine and upper management lack patience, empathy, and listening skills after the auction. I wouldn't recommend XYZ Storage. It is different from All Canadian Storage.",2023-06-02 12:35:02,2,google,KSrade80@gmail.com,Sharon Acco,scarborough

"The only good thing I can say is the staff were really nice  both over the phone and when I moved in yesterday – didn't get the girl's name yesterday but pretty much she was the only highlight of the facility. Overally I am pretty disappointed with the unit and all – signed on with work perks that shoudl have given me 3 months off that was conveniently dropped and not in the lease... also there was no pro-rate for the month of march either? the lease too for some reason seems really...sketchy like not what i thought I had signed nor paid for. Nonetheless, can't justify paying $200/month for a glorified closet AND having to drive out to hellandgone with no easy 24/7 self-access... and calling the location scarborough is a bit of a stretch – it's pretty much in pickering, let's be real. Found a  much more convenient storage facility that is same size, 75/month BEFORE any promotions, closer to me, and offering 3 months at half off.

"Excellent storage facilities.

Great location and the service you get from the staff are outstanding.

I did call the main number and spoke to Mary who gave me all the options and reversed the storage and immediately emailed me what was discussed and promised.

On March 15th, I visited the storage and was  welcomed by Dorian Thomas the Client Experience Manager. She showed me few options in terms of sizes and pricing of lockers. This was very helpful as we may upgrade to a larger locker in few months.

Thank you Mary and Dorian for the outstanding service.

"Initially, storing things here was great as the layout of the building is easy to navigate and it’s relatively clean.

That changed however when they started trying to increase rent prices every 5 or 6 months which is just ridiculous. They keep the prices down for new clients though but existing clients constantly have prices jacked up. It’s really a poor way to treat clients. It almost started to seem like they were doing to it to see how long they could keep pushing you. I kept having to move to smaller units until it got to the point where a new client would be paying significantly less than I was for the same sized unit. The first year was fine and they upped prices at a reasonable rate but maybe management changed because within the last two years, it’s been terrible. 

I wouldn’t recommend renting here long term or at all. There are other places that only increase prices every 10 to 12 months. 

On top of that, depending on who you get, the front desk workers are either lovely or not great. I once was in the process of moving things over to a new unit and the whole process was poorly handled. ",2023-10-02 17:50:23,2,OPIO,xeniapetrova1696269021263@guest.opio,Xenia Petrova,

She was very prompt in answering all our queries and made sure our experience at XYZ storage is exceptional. Thank you Melissa - you are a true asset to the team :).

"The place is clean and secure, well lit and priced right but I really gave them five stars because the young lady helping us was great.

I needed indoor heated storage for 2 seadoos.  I thought we had reserved a locker but when we went there 2 weeks later they said they had no record of the reservation.  They did help us get a locker though.

User tip
If you have an 8' wide trailer to stow and you're not an expert with trailers then avoid getting a locker in row B   The laneway is too narrow to maneouvre an 8 ft wide trailer through 8.5 wide doors.  We tried manually pushing it in but there was also a 1 in lip at the door we couldn't climb.  They switched us to Row C and everything went in perfect.

"Having never rented a locker before for temporary storage, was a little apprehensive as to whether or not it was really needed and justified the extra expense, especially since we  had access to someone's garage to use. Well, certainly glad that we went the storage route. Given the weather that we've been having that would have otherwise frozen some of the items we had stored were it not for the temperature controlled environment, the convenience of access, and especially the peace of mind of security, certainly made it much easier on us. With all the stresses that moving entails, this was a very welcome one less thing to worry about!

Also a special shout out to Candice who certainly went above and beyond to help and accommodate us! Very much appreciated!",2023-03-11 22:46:34,5,google,MYvknh08@gmail.com,Alexander Sechin,etobicoke

From the smiles at the door to Natalia making me a hot coffee on a cold day and finding me a better unit than I even thought I needed, I cannot tell you how highly I recommend this company.  They even let me store a U-Haul truck from another company on the premises overnight when I was stuck in a snowstorm.  Love love love - keep up the great work!  And Karl!

"Rented a unit after my mom passed away in Nov. 2020 to store her stuff til I could figure out what I wanted to do with her stuff.  Staff was amazing upon rental and place is so very clean. The access was great to. In May of 2022 I decided to take her stuff out and end my rental with XYZ storage at the Beachgrove location. I was paying by cheque cos I don't have a cc. When I moved out they told me I was to receive a cheque in the mail for $30.07. It's 3 months later and I haven't received my cheques. I called and was told to come in the next day to get a cash refund.  Why wasn't this an option in May when I ended my rental unit contract, I dont know. So I went in the following day and was told they have no cash on site and I needed to come back on Tues after the Aug. Long wknd. The woman at the counter assured me she was leaving a note and she wrote the note while I was there. I'm upset because I have been patient and waiting for the cheque, I wasted gas to go there like I was told and now I have to go back again in hopes I can get my money. This is the only bad thing I can say about the place. They were quick to take their money but not to give whats owed. They also raised the prices twice in the 1.5 yrs I was there with them. Way to expensive for what I got. Anyway like anything do you homework before making decision. I really hope I can get my money on Tues.",2022-08-01 04:14:41,3,google,JOynit47@gmail.com,Bridget Marques,scarborough

The lady at the desk (Natalie ), was so helpful, considerate and just provided a really great experience and was able to help me through all my hesitations on location, selecting a size and just overall moving day plans even when I needed to change things, they were so considerate and helpful.

Really good people always make the experience and it's the reason I trust this company, i'm really happy with how helpful they were before, during and even after the move.

"Great Customer service from Doreen and Alex at the reception. Helpful with the inconvenience of changes of units without complaint. No contract required.

The review above was 18 months ago and that does not change. I will add that it's clean and seems safe.

However, Today I closed my unit. In 18 months the Price of the unit was bumped up twice with an extra 50 dollars from the original price. The price was not in sync with the size of the unit. For that reason, I moved out of XYZ to another storage. I reduced the stars from 5 to 3 for this reason. Price was determinant",2021-12-02 20:31:19,3,google,NHvveb54@gmail.com,Kenneth K,scarborough

"Super disappointing experience. Was a loyal customer for several years. Since XYZ took over the location they constantly tried to implement price increases. Their price increases often meant a higher price being charged to a existing loyal customer then a new customer (even without a initial promo). There are numerous lower cost options nearby.

When I closed my account the form in their office did not work. Staff were well aware and clearly frustrated with management's lack of attention to this.

I don't know about others, but I work in customer service/sales and can genuinely appreciate well-run businesses with kind and supportive staff.

"My extremely negative experience: I waited outside for their posted opening time. The employee didn't even arrive to work until they were already 10 minutes late to open. And rather than apologizing or even making up a lame excuse, this person rudely insisted that 10 minutes is not late. I waited for them them to unlock the loading dock which finally happened 22 minutes after their posted opening time, and there was no way I was going to get to work on time. I could not help but point out that we were now well past 10 minutes, and that I'd have been fired from any retail job I'd ever had for opening 22 minutes late as a matter of course.
Most of the people who work here are awesome. They are warm, courteous, professional, and eager to help. But to put it mildly they have the wrong person opening in the morning. And the other reason for the low marks are that the place does not have 24/7 access.",2022-03-10 14:45:49,2,google,HSdhpw72@gmail.com,Sean Ward,etobicoke

"Excellent experience. Seamless booking process - they were very flexible too! The access and storage instructions are super easy to follow. Staff is really friendly and accomodating. Only challenge is you cant book an elevator so if you're moving multiple items to a unit on an upper floor, you have to take multiple trips. However, there's a way around that - i used the after hours access at 8 AM, and was able to use the elevators all to myself to unload all the items of a 2 bed condo without any hassle.",2023-06-04 02:39:30,5,google,QVssys58@gmail.com,Navneet Vallat,toronto-downtown

Three months later…. The move out was equally friendly and made even easier by using the XYZ truck ….which was inexpensive and on-site. ( it’s only free if you have a massive locker….but it’s competitive and ever so convenient)

"XYZ was fine for the first couple of years. Unfortunately, perhaps due to new management, they can no longer be trusted with your belongings or your money.

I fell into arrears last year due to COVID-related layoffs. I phoned them up begging them not to auction my belongings, and to my pleasant surprise, we came to an agreement. I would pay $400 twice a month -- enough to cover rent, late fees, plus a bit extra -- until I was back on track. They didn't have to agree to this, but they did, and for that much I'm grateful.

Some months later, the trouble started. After submitting authorization for a payment, they initially didn't accept it. When I phoned them to see what was going on, they said the manager ""wasn't confident"" that I would be able to keep up the payment schedule -- even though I had done for months. I reminded them that verbal agreements of this nature are legally binding, and that ""confidence"" has nothing to do with it. They acquiesced.

A couple months later, the same thing happened again.

Now, a shaky grasp of the law would be bad enough, but the worst was yet to come. One day I opened up my banking, and discovered that in addition to the $400 payment I had authorized, they had extracted an additional $300+ that I hadn't. Of course I demanded they refund it. And then for several days, nothing happened. Whenever I called in, I was simply told that ""tech support is handling it"". Finally, I submitted a formal dispute on the charge through my bank. That came through a few days later, but in the meantime I had to pawn my belongings just to scrape by. Finally, AFTER the dispute process had returned my money, and a full week after the debacle started, I heard back from the manager that she had been trying to refund my money but was having some difficulties. All that time and she hadn't bothered reaching out to me.

And at the time, although I was certainly furious, I figured she had fat-fingered the payment process, submitting it twice by accident. After all, both payments were extracted on the same day. Unfortunately, I can no longer offer her the benefit of the doubt, because today an unauthorized charge of $820 was made to my account. Let me emphasize: I had been planning to submit authorization for the usual $400 that evening, but I hadn't done it. So without any word of authorization, she simply took it upon herself to extract, not even the usual payment, but the full balance owing to them, from my bank account.

The worst part of it is there's nothing I can do about it. Sure, I'll get my money back one way or another, but this keeps happening, and it's incredibly disruptive. I would love to cut all ties with XYZ Storage, but they have all my belongings, and as I'm living on the other side of the country, it would cost me a lot more than I can afford to have those belongings moved. So I'm held hostage to a company that apparently doesn't care about basic things like the law when it comes to taking money from their customers.

"A good size, conveniently located facility, helpful people! This location was called All Canadian Self Storage when I originally rented the storage space, and although I just downsized my storage, I enjoyed about eight years of reliable service. Hours are reasonable (currently 9a-7p M-S, 9a-5p Sunday) and my belongings were in good condition, which tells me they have reliable climate control.  My only caveat is that the cost of your rental agreement may increase considerably if you keep the space over a multiple year period; in my case, from 2014 through 2022, the monthly cost effectively doubled. The saving grace is the customer service, which is excellent proportionate to cost.

I rented a compact 12 - 25 square ft unit (which is their smallest).  The unit was a perfect size and in the end I had a boxed couch, t.v, bed frame, mattress, desk, chair etc and still had ample room.
Downside - only open durning business hours.  24/h access is not available. I rented on the phone and didn’t realize I would be on the second floor!  This was a huge issue since I was moving alone and box’s out of my car onto a dolly, into a freight elevator and about 300feet down a creepy penitentiary looking hallway.

"4 reasons why they deserve more than 5 stars for this rating reviews..location wise, its within my area and less traffic going there and back. Another reason is the place---it's so much better (neat,peaceful,and the paint of the storage units looks like new) compared to others. Third reason is the price...I got it for almost  half of the price...(it's an online promo). Lastly, none of this will be possible if not for Alex. Very accomodating and respectful in a professional manner. To whoever hired this gentleman, kudos 👏 to you for hiring a top quality employee ...

Also it’s code entry so no mag key to loose or forget at home, which is nice

"Even though it was clear we needed a storage unit, it took some figuring out to determine first what general size, then what specific dimensions were going to work for our needs. Besides the descriptions for each unit, we needed to actually see some options. Natalie was very friendly and helpful with information, plus she took the time to show us a few different available units. She was also very patient with us, even though we had to discuss and come back more than once before we finally picked the right unit. She was very helpful at every step from booking to moving in. Definitely great customer service - thank you, Natalie!
The hours are the only thing that we have a minor issue with, yet they are still a bit better than other companies. Perhaps the hours are a good thing when it comes to security.
The entire facility is very clean and COVID-conscious, with no-touch hand sanitizer dispensers and they even have masks available from a vending machine! The free-to-use heavy duty carts and pallet trucks at the loading bays make it easy to get your things in or out. Overall, this is a great facility and we're happy that we chose to come here.

"I rented a storage locker just before Christmas and I had the pleasure of dealing with Melissa Davidson.  I had a million questions regarding my options, pricing, access, etc. and they were all answered with confidence and patience.  In addition to Melissa's knowledge she has a sunny disposition and because of this she makes the office environment  calm and you are made to feel part of the team.  Yesterday, I dropped in with more questions as I wanted to store my Christmas decorations and I was greeted by name and with the same sunny disposition.  She makes the whole experience seamless and I am thinking perhaps I should get a larger locker.  I know from experience that good employees are hard to find and I believe you have a gem in Melissa.  I would highly recommend XYZ storage and especially Melissa.  Thank you.

The facility is well lit and feels secure. We know they look after their facility and customers because  we inadvertently did not lock our unit properly one day. We soon got a phone call advising us of this. That is reassuring. The plans and rentals are very flexible.

"There were no elevators to get to my compact locker that I have to get my bins of personal possessions to clean out my locker.  I had arrived  there 30 minutes before closing that I asked them if they could give me more time to get my possessions through the stairs by myself.  Some of the staff mostly custodian staff were rushed me to get all my possessions out before the storage room closing that I almost hurt my back and I was sweating like crazy with no air conditioning provided.  Luckily I got all my possessions out into my small car just a few minutes after closing about 10 minutes that I felt injured on my back with no elevator were provided.  If anyone want to rent a compact locker at this location, good luck!  You will have carrying your possessions up and down on these stairs with NO HELP.

"This was not a good experience at all.  The female who made less than zero attempt to resolve the problem that they created was uncaring and dismissive.  The location at Beechgrove was at least not apathetic and showed interest in giving good customer service; they listened.  To this date I am not sure where my unit is located, whether it's Duncan Mills road or  Mississauga.  The last straw was the unauthorized credit card payment that had to be reversed when sent a screenshot showing that they had taken a payment at the same time I made an online payment for my monthly fees  Due to that fiasco, I overpaid, the difference was supposed to be deducted from my redelivery charges, or so I was told by the male who arranged for my redelivery and cancellation of service, it never happened.  I currently have a credit on an account which will be closed, thankfully and I don't expect to be paid back as I have no confidence in this company to be honest or ethical.  This experience was truly a nightmare not wished on anyone.  I would not recommend XYZ Storage to anyone.  They did not value my business, the treatment from them was just awful.  The worst of it was getting a cold letter informing me that my storage location had moved to another city.  I chose them initially because they were close for ease of access to my unit.  The impact of this was significant and not in a good way.  The end of this toxic experience cannot come too soon.  I pray that my last few weeks with this company will pass without further trauma.",2019-11-05 06:40:02,1,google,GCeuod56@gmail.com,Stone Kalten,scarborough

Bright, simple and easy to use, it's great to be storing our stuff in your first class building.However, its biggest asset by far is your star employee Jordan Lai.

"So far so good on Day 1 of storage. Very clean. Fairly easy access. Super helpful staff (thank you Gloria). Really good value for money because I took a second floor unit that requires stairs (so check the rental agreement carefully) but with gyms closed I'm happy for a free cross-fit style work out :)
An update to say it was a great experience all the way through to move-out today. Being fully indoors for unit access was a huge benefit during the winter.
If I could suggest one improvement it would be to make after hours access easier. But that was only an inconvenience one one occasion.",2021-01-03 21:24:41,5,google,PMegip93@gmail.com,Ian Kamm,toronto-midtown

"I was in the market for short term storage while undergoing a renovation.
I came across XYZ storage on line whom was also recommended to me by an acquaintance.
Great friendly welcoming staff!
They walk you through their units and explain their company etiquette ensuring you understand their standards and process.

Safety was the number one criteria as most storage providers have a 24 hour access which can be concerning. This facility operates within regulated times and does not permit after hours access. XYZ monitors their premises 24/7 which adds piece of mind.

They provide an accessible, well lit,
clean and secured facility with a variety of unit sizes tailored to your needs.

Customer service is outstanding and reassuring. They are a super fun group to chat with and offer sound advice for any concerns.

Totally recommend!

She was very knowledgeable in the prices of each individual object/item that I needed. She also was very quick on the phone when I needed help knowing what kind of gas the truck needed. When it came to us coming back she was able to easily problem solve whatever issue we had. If it was out of 10 I would say 11! ,2019-07-23 19:29:41,5,OPIO,w9e9xsqrq@op.io,Curtis C,scarborough

"Update: After 3 years being a customer and dealing with different people I can say that the counter is being managed by the worst I’ve ever met. What a terrible experience during my move out, incredibly rude and careless staff. I will never take services from XYZ again, not only because they had increased my rent twice in less than 2 years for the smallest unit expecting that I pay $73+tax per month now, which is outrageous considering they are offering new units for $45 with the first six months at $33… can’t really understand the logic behind customer retention and rotation… but because of the significant decline in the customer service approach altogether. Do not recommend, don’t waste your time and money on this place.

I’m more than happy with the service Gloria provided for me today! She is welcoming, helpful and considerate. She made it so easy and it was clear she really knows her business. Best experience ever! Highly recommended. Thanks Gloria!!

"The staff were very efficient providing the answers to all my questions clearly and without hesitation. The premises are  clean, well lit and unlike the other 3 self storage businesses I visited in the area there is no
outer gate to be navigated.  Instead you go straight to one of the 5 doors
accessing the interior,  key in your own code and your on your way to your locker.  They also had a superior choice of sizes.  All in all , a real winner.

"I had the worst experience with this company: they treat customers like hostages: they lure new customers with low rates and couple of months later, they hike their prices, reduce hours of service. I got stuck twice at Beechgrove location, and no one answering the emergency number they provided. When I call the day after, they told me I should have called 911 !!!  I also had a customer service rep hang up the phone while I was talking complaining about being stuck inside. By the way, they changed name (formerly 'All Canadian Storage') probably to make people forget their bad service. #XYZStorageBadService",2019-07-04 16:07:26,1,google,AFcbwg83@gmail.com,Bob Raptors,scarborough

"All Canadian Self Storage is hands down the best storage facility I’ve used. The process began when I filled out an inquiry form online. Within the hour I was emailed the storage contract. Natasha was the first agent. She answered all my emails swiftly and was patient and answered all my questions. She was also very accommodating and honoured their promo-rate despite me being a day late returning my signed contract.

Next step was to visit the location to complete the sign-up process. I walked in and was greeted with a smile as soon as I entered. I remember looking around because I wasn’t sure if the attendant was addressing me. I’m so used to stuffy and cold storage facilities so the energy was noticeably different. The office was bright and inviting. Both workers had very upbeat demeanour.

Copeland was his name. He toured me around the space, showed me my future unit and gave me moving instructions. I was also offered coffee and chocolate while I waited. He was also very patient and accommodating!

I highly recommend this location to anyone looking to store their stuff. You will not be disappointed!

"My experience at ACSS has been nothing but positive. I first picked up a small locker to store some extra belongings when I moved into a nearby condo. The staff happily set me up and explained everything in detail. The facilities are clean, safe, secure, and very accessible. More recently, I was in need of a much larger storage solution for my business (10'x20'), and I have to call out how helpful Melissa and Natalie were! There was only one locker of that size left, and I didn't need it right away. They worked with me to secure the locker with a pro-rated month, and I couldn't be happier. I now have peace of mind that when my shipment arrives next month, I will not be scrambling to find the space. This facility is top notch - the lockers, loading docks, moving equipment, storefront, etc. are all great, and the staff is even better!",2019-04-16 15:42:02,5,google,SIusto75@gmail.com,Spencer Gooderham,etobicoke

She took her time with me showing me my unit and how to use the lift, and helped me get a cart to move my stuff in. The unit itself was clean and very easy to access. The drive through lanes make it so easy to move in and out. Overall I think this place is a great value, especially considering the customer service is amazing.

When we first obtained storage with this location (originally called All Canadian Self Storage) in 2014 I loved it and was glad to have our stuff stored here. Totally gave it a glowing 5 stars then. Of course that was long before they decided to go outside of Canada and also chaged the name.  Not sure what happened to Natalie that helped us back then. However nowadays customer service is not what it used to be.  Theres issues making payments through their Online Portal which I contacted them more than once about so I can get it rectified.  No help was given whatsoever and No acknowledgement of my email to them.   They were more than gkad to email me though to notify of a Late payment and add a late fee.   Smh.  Disappointed in them.  Until they do whats right etc  my review stands at 1 star.,2019-01-01 02:14:17,1,google,PLurwm58@gmail.com,S0me 1,scarborough

"I rented a Uhaul van from XYZ Storage on Oct 12, 2019 and have the relevant receipts and order back this up. The Uhaul van itself was fine, but XYZ Storage did not have, or give any warning that the furniture dolly which was part of my order, was not going to be provided.

I needed to move a single piece of heavy furniture, and without this equipment, I could not use the van. When I asked to cancel the order they refused. Although they provided an alternate piece of moving equipment, it was not as good as what I had originally ordered and this was my first negative customer experience with this company.

Although I still took the van and managed on my own anyways, I filled the van with 7 litres of fuel ($8.30) at the Husky Gas station across the street, to exactly where the fuel gauge was marked when I originally rented the van. I drove less than 25 KM in total.

The location instead lied about where the fuel gauge was when returned, and charged an additional $26.00 in fuel surcharges which should not have occurred. When I called to dispute they said they would look into it. I did not receive any further call back, and instead saw that they went ahead and charged my credit card for the additional fuel incorrectly.

I will be disputing these charges with my credit card as this company operates in a fraudulent manner. I will also be reporting them to the BBB - Better Business Bureau and following up with Uhaul to lodge a formal complaint against XYZ Storage, located at 1 Laird Dr, Toronto.

If you want to rent equipment from these people:

1) Call ahead to verify equipment - there is a good chance they will not have what you ordered

2) Take photo proof of mileage and gauges, before and after filling up with gas. There is a good chance they will lie about this afterwords to make extra profit.

Bottom line - this company lies about their Uhaul gas milage in order to make more money. When caught, they will charge your credit card on file anyways instead of resolving the issue with their customers.

-------------

UPDATE (10/19/2019) - Called Uhaul to lodge a complaint, and they were nice enough to acknowledge that this was not supposed to happen and refunded me the $26 that was charged in additional fuel charges. This takes care of my main issue - however, be careful if renting Uhaul vehicles from this location to save yourself the trouble.",2019-10-19 17:22:53,1,google,IThqed51@gmail.com,David Kong,toronto-midtown

"I am a very patient person and definitely not perfect. I signed up online for the free month after calling and speaking with someone asking if the site was 24 hours. They told me yes. The day I went in to start my account the lady at the desk multiple times couldn’t find my agreement, kept telling me the wrong prices etc, I said no I signed up online here is my agreement and here is the price. she said she would get the manager to amend it. I trust it no problem, paid my pro-rated amount and left to go to my condo to get the uhaul truck loaded. I came back and proceeded to use the code and it didn’t work, so I went to the front and the facility was closed. I now had a full uhaul truck, I had to pay for the uhaul truck another day, and unloaded in the morning.

the following month I got a call and email telling me I owed a balance, I explained in more than 15 calls that it’s the first month free, even having to go in and show a screen shot because they told me no that promo didn’t exist last month. They said manager would credit the service and didnt.

The following month comes and I left the country and didn’t even remember on my own fault of my own that my card got compromised and didn’t update the storage place. They told me my balance was for the month I said no problem, went in and cleared it up and gave them my new card.

Following month I leave for work purposes and my card expiry changes and I think nothing of it as I already updated the card to the storage unit. I then come back they tell me I owe two months. I say no problem let me split up the payments what do I owe? they say 701.00 I say okay I will pay 400.00 today and 300.00 tomorrow. That’s exactly what I did. I even bought too mattress pads. I ask the lady how to move out my belongings the following month, she explains the process and i say thanks.

I came the following day to add some things in the locker and they have a for sale auction sign on my locker because I owe money. So I go to the front the lady at the front says let me pull up your account, she looks and says you owe 11.30 I said I was here last night why didn’t they tell me that, she said she works at another location she doesn’t know. I called head office to complain because they wouldn’t remove the lock for the 11.30$ that they said I owed although I was there yesterday. Again a manager was to call me back and never did. I paid the 11.30 and they cut the lock off.

the following month comes and I get a call that I owe 300$ I say for what? they tell me Jan. I said i was just there paying the balance owing and the lady said i don’t owe anything. I said can I speak with a manager. For 30 days now I have been calling back and forth to speak to a manager trying to clarify where the balance is coming from.

I finally find how to look online and see the balances and the entire time they weren’t giving me the balance I was supposed to owe. Which fine that is my own fault for not paying attention to my bills,

I agree to pay this balance, however I have been asking to speak to a manager for 15 days now because money is extremely tight as i’m moving saturday, and I don’t have an extra 300$ to pay it. They told me if I don’t pay it by the 7 another full month of service is owed but I don’t even get paid until the 8th.

I asked if I could make a half payment and open the locker so I can remove things and then they can rent the locker and come pay my balance by the 8th. They told me no, you know you owe the balance, people have hung up on me, the manager never calls me back.

i’m not disputing the balance that’s fine, i’m asking for some compassion as a company, since your employees choose not to return calls or give proper information.

the only person who is remotely helpful was the one who I just spoke with who said she would speak to another manager to see what I can do.
I was in tears on the phone, as I really don’t have more money to pay this but I need to move on saturday.

"Very poor customer service, U-haul should re-evaluate if they should sell their products or not.
Had a confirmation of a truck and a dolly at this location for 24 hours. Pickup was 3pm.
What happened is I was told that they’re sold out of the dolly and I can only purchase one. I asked about the price and she’s like it’s somewhere in the board pointing at my back!

Okay it made me not buy one and think why am I not getting the one I asked for! They said it’s a first come first serve thing!! I wasn’t convinced but indeed upset.

I asked where is the truck, she’s like it’s somewhere out in the parking. Even my friend with me was shocked from the attitude.
By the way it was not busy and we were the only ones in store.

Afterwards the next morning 7 am I received a call from them saying I have to return the truck!! I told them I can’t I need at least 3-4 hours to offload and bring back the truck!!
The lady said well you have to bring it now, I explained that I have a reservation until 3pm and I was confirmed. She said you’re gonna get charged! I told her I can’t accept that because I have a 24 truck I don’t care if you have other reservations.
She said we’ll figure it out with uhaul.
I did call them and they fixed this issue and what they said is that I shouldn’t worry and I wouldn’t be charged extras.
And they’ve told me that the next customer is at 3pm. So that means the girl there lied and wanted to charge me and wasn’t meeting basic customer service ethics.

I also needed a storage and of course I want to different company because I wasn’t really sure that I want to spent a penny at this location. I didn’t even want to ask about any storage and that is not all by sudden.

Improve .. or Good luck!!

"Amazing service and great facility

Moving to a remote workplace and required a storage location for events set up materials and legacy documents.

Gloria, what an amazing customer service staff member! She immediately starting asking all the relevant questions, and you require a personal code to access the indoors, and she personalized it (you get a pre determined one, but went the extra effort).
She walked us through the whole process, tried the code, perfect.
Gloria took us into the facility, showed us our location, all elevators, exits, trolleys, and recycling bins (bring your ewaste, and paper recycling if need be).

Storage was very clean (10x10 for us), doors and locks are secure. Temperature controlled, dry, so need not worry about your documents.

Plenty of boxes to purchase, but they also recycle, so if you don't have a big job, you can use those.

Overall great experience, highly recommend you use their services for all storage needs.

If you're lucky, you will have Gloria's help, but they were all friendly and helpful.

Can be tricky pulling in off Laird, but not too difficult. Just be patient, it's worth it.

Cheers, Jay",2019-04-06 13:07:24,5,google,EPumnt06@gmail.com,Jason Blow,toronto-midtown

"Typically I don't write reviews, but after having such a positive experience for the past few months with All Canadian Self-Storage on Lakeshore, I just had to! This is by far the best storage facility there ever was in every way possible! The location is central, easy to find and access by vehicle or TTC from any direction. The office and storage area are beautiful and well thought out; upon walking in right away you will notice how clean, organized, stocked with extra packing supplies and very well maintained the place is. The building is very secure, the quality of air and temperature throughout it is excellent and even the bathroom is spotless and equipped with necessities at all times. Loading, unloading is effortless as is parking. The rates are very decent and fairly calculated so you don't have unexpected costs. The staff are helpful, thoughtful, friendly, approachable, knowledgeable, professional, proud of their work, and it shows! Their customer care is exceptional. You will feel welcomed and relaxed as they take care of the details of your storage needs, like right away giving me a bigger locker when I first arrived from Vancouver and miscalculated how much stuff I had. Then, when I needed to downsize, in no time a smaller locker was reserved for me, thoughtfully and conveniently right across from the existing one, making it an easy transition. Every time I've called, the staff communicated clearly and answered my questions in a friendly, informative, professional manner putting my mind at ease.  I was even served coffee while waiting in the office for my ride. Taking care of little details like that on top of everything else makes this a FIVE STAR PLUS experience!  I highly recommend All Canadian Self-Storage and would like to say a big THANK YOU to the staff for making my move across the continent that much easier!

"They were the easiest part of my move. I was looking to store my 1bedroom apartment as I temporarily move across the country. I got an email promo, so I decided to inquire about details. Originally sent an email asking about availability and quotes, then realized, to be faster, I should just call the general info line. Nothing crazy, it was average customer service, so I went back to window shopping my options. 10 min later I got a call from Sarah answering my original email. She was amazing! She really dug in and went above and beyond to help me figured out my needs and look into van rental availability.
I went to check out the facility beforehand. Really nice, bright and clean. Remy was so kind and fast at doing the rental process. On the day of the move Omar was just as sweet and quick to get us into the van.
The moving van drive was good! It was only one year old, but they only rent it out to their customers. So not just any schmo is damaging it like the U-Hauls. The van came with a built in ramp and easy to handle.
Overall they were the best and easiest part of this whole moving process, and I can’t thank them enough! I will totally be using them more often and highly recommend them!",2021-03-07 15:55:51,5,google,SSapac81@gmail.com,Anita Yung,toronto-downtown

Lela at xyz was the most professional aspect of my week.  She helped me get the right size unit at the best price.  Listened to my situation and worked to make it easy for me without any upselling or impatient stuff you sometimes get when doing something for the first time. Facility has alot of great options and is very convenient.  Also the 3 month half off is a great deal.  Lots of flexibility with changing your unit etc. All in all very pain free.

"I am writing to thank All Canadian Self Storage for their amazing service and support during our recent downsizing. As anyone who has been through it will attest, downsizing can be a physically and emotionally trying experience.
I arrived at All-Canadian Self Storage on Laird Drive to do the first step of what I expected to be a 2 or 3 step process of consolidating 2 large lockers into one.
To my surprise and delight I was told that there were 2 workers there that would be available to help me. When I asked how much they charged I was told that it was a free service provided to their customers.
Well it turned out that the “workers” Chris and Leslie are part owners of the facility. They worked their magic and with Tetris like precision managed to get an impossible number of items into one temporary unit - and then placed the remaining items into a tiny locker to be stored on a longer term basis. What would otherwise have taken me days was accomplished in a matter of hours. Also I can't imagine any hired movers working as hard to fit as many items into each locker!
I can’t recommend this company more highly. Everyone I have encountered there has been friendly and helpful. As well. the drive through facility offers an unmatched level of convenience when accessing your locker.
I will always remember the kind help I received last Saturday from my ‘angels’ Leslie and Chris!!

"No question this is a clean and well run business. The facility is well laid out. For the most part the employees are courteous and helpful. I did have some difficultly with a couple of their managers over inconsistent billing practices. Initially they were condescending and dismissive, but after they realized their error things got better.
I was referred to this facility back in 2019 when the storage facility I was in closed. XYZ offered to honor the rental rate I was getting at DVP storage for a year. This was a new facility that had just opened up and so they were highly motivated at the time to fill up the facility.
What they did not tell me was they would also levy a $10+ a month charge for insurance. With 1,600 storage units in the building this amounts to $16,000 monthly additional payments. My guess is they use this capital to also pay their own insurance for the building. After 6 months I received notice of a rate increase. My rate went up over $10 a month. When I asked them about the agreement to hold rate for a year - I was told it was only for 6 months. In talking to my insurance broker I found out that my home owner insurance covered off site contents. I asked XYZ about this. They told me if I was to supply proof of coverage they would defer the additional insurance charge. Done...or do I thought. When in the office 2 months later, trying to arrange for 24hr access (joke). I was told I would be receiving a letter about rate increase. When I asked what it was going up to, they told me I'd need to wait to receive the letter. I figured something was up.
When the letter came the increase was almost double. My monthly rent increased by over $100. Wow!
When I tried to reason with manager that this was an unacceptable rate increase I was stonewalled. He was not open to discussion.
I was able to find a storage facility less then 1km away that was offering the same rate for same sized locker I had before this last increase.
While this new facility might not have all the ""bell's and whistles"" that XYZ offered.. do I really want to pay extra for ""free coffee"" and 24hr access...that is not really 24hr access.
Moving on.

In Response to owner
I see you have asked me to call to discuss my experience. I really do not see the point. I have already moved out of your facility. The time to explanation/discussion was back when I tried to talk to someone when I first received the notice, instead of the "" sorry those are the new rates Sir, we hope you decide to stay""
I have talked to 2 other who were hit with the same level of price increase as I was. Both moved from the same facility as me into your new building last year. You needed us then to help fill you facility, now you don't need us. I get it. As I said in my honest review, you have a clean, tightly run facility. I am just storing stuff I really don't need, so I don't need to house it in the most experience storage in the GTA.
My guess is you were banking on people who would just pay the ridiculous increase rather then go through the effort and frustration if moving out.",2021-01-01 13:33:32,3,google,KScpgq62@gmail.com,Phillip Tallman,toronto-downtown

"Being one of the early tenants at XYZ Storage at Eastern Avenue, my storage unit was very conveniently located on the main floor, literally steps away from the loading area. My house was being renovated and i wanted to have easy and convenient access to the next season of clothes, etc. When comparing prices for XYZ against a similar storage building in the area, the other business charged a fee for every 30days whereas XYZ charges on the basis of a month. The facilities are very clean and there are lots of carts to help you transfer your worldly possessions between your vehicle and your  unit. Sadly, my renovations are over so I am giving up my fabulous ground floor unit .... i should have checked on sub-letting!!

"So I had to pack and ship a large guitar in a large hard case to Winnipeg, and the box people I called were less than helpful (""you wanna what!!?) at all the nearby locations. Except for Maria, at All Canadian on Lake Shore at Legion Rd., who got thoughtful after checking all her available sizes, and said that I should bring it by so they could try and figure it out. The 3 office staff spent an unbelievable amount of time wrestling the guitar into a box they cut up and created on the spot, with great humour and an excellent taping job.

"I had my stuff in their portable storage for 5 months. It's very reasonably priced and it's easy to organize a driver to drop off a portable storage unit so I could pack everything in it.  The 2 drivers for both drop off and pick up were extremely helpful, professional and most of all--nice. There was NO DAMAGE to any of my items. and all was intact. The unit was clean.

When I needed the company to drop off my portable storage unit, I just had to give 1-2 weeks notice. The driver who dropped off my storage unit was very polite and helpful. He went over and above his duties and offered to help me move since he was also returning my unit on the same day.

The only negative thing was the 2 office staff members who did NOT understand for some reason that I was ALL PAID UP.. before the driver dropped off my stuff -- on the last trip... I had to clarify with them I was paid up .. they left me 2 annoying messages on my phone.

"I was here because of the Google rating and convenience. After I left I felt deeply regretted.

1: There opening hours usually covers my working hour. Well I should be more careful myself.
2: I chose a locker with a much higher rate because of near the loading zone. During my final move, a staff's car blocked the loading zone all at once, parking there for nothing. I informed the staff and around half an hour, the staff came and I was almost done for my move.
3: When I opened the account the front agent said one of there major advantages is the ""rent by day"" prorated rate. After I moved out I have not received any email receipt as the indicated. I started to feel suspicious and request for the receipt, and the final receipt charged a full month rate (which is extra 10 days). Guess what happened when I asked for the prorated rent in email? See the last screenshot.

One star deducted for each bad points. 2 stars left now in total.

I felt like my experience sort of unique. This place will still glorify, while I tried my best not to choose any locker service again. Whenever I drove around the Lake Shore and see this place, it ended up a sleepless night.

I felt like I was fooled by Google review, and to be honest, it is not a good feeling find myself stupid.

Maybe locker service is just not for me.

"I came to the store on a busy start of month day to rent a cargo van. I was greeted by staff who immediately offered me coffee or tea. From that moment on, the experience only increased in pleasantry. The staff advised me that while no vehicles were available at the moment, they could see which stores were closest and rent a vehicle for me at another location. I advised them that I was pressed for time and only needed a vehicle to transport a mattress, as the cords I had securing the mattress to my vehicle were inadequate. Understanding I was pressed for time and that a vehicle was not immediately available, the staff instead offered to provide me with adequate cords to secure the mattress. Not only did they supply the cords, but they even assisted in ensuring the mattress was secure before I drove away. I am grateful for the professionalism and customer service that was displayed and will definitely recommend this location in future.

"We recently had a disappointing experience with XYZ's mobile storage service on Friday August 28th. 

Initially we were told our containers would arrive between 11am-12pm;  then 1pm-2pm; then between 6pm and 6:30pm.  We ultimately received our storage containers at 6:40pm.  In total, we waited for the delivery of our storage containers for an additional 6.5 hours after our original quoted delivery time.  Not once were we called to be notified of a delay in our container delivery-- we reached out to XYZ Storage throughout the day for updates.

We were assured that the driver would call when they were 30 minutes away; that never occurred.

Finally, at 6:30pm when our containers still hadn't arrived, I spoke with someone regarding my frustration.  I provided my name and telephone number and was assured that someone would call me back either Friday or Saturday to discuss my displeasure.  Still, no one has called.

Ultimately, due to the delay in the delivery or our storage containers, we had to delay our relocation by an entire day.

I understand hiccups in deliveries-- plans change, sick calls happen-- but there is no excuse for the lack of transparent communication with customers.  I'm disappointed by the quality of the customer service at XYZ. The next time I search for storage services, I'll be sure to use another company.",2020-08-30 17:53:01,negative,facebook,,Sammantha Marie,toronto-downtown

The facility was very clean and very well organized. The staff were always courteous and helpful. Accessing my locker couldn't be simpler. I also used the mobile units - this team was fantastic. Carl extremely was excellent with making sure the containers were secure and ready for transport. He went though all the procedures quite diligently and was prompt with his drop offs and pick ups. Fahad (sp?) was also great to work with. He made every effort to get 2 mobile storage units to fit on my driveway to make it easier to access.

After viewing other offerings at other facilities and seeing what All Canadian Self-Storage has to offer, we are confident that we have made the right choice.

"A moth infestation in my unit was reported 10 days ago at the Weston facility and there has been no acceptable response from customer service. They put in moth traps after  days and days of calling, a strategy that couldn't possibly be sufficient to remedy a full scale infestation.  No managers are available to speak to, customer service won't give out their full names of any managers, and I am sure other units adjacent to mine are being affected as well.

"Shopping around for storage unit can be a daunting task. You have to account for a number of factors to name a few: location, price, cleanliness, accessibility, and the security of your belongings. I am happy to say that this past month (March 2020) I was able to find these attributes at XYZ storage on Eastern.
During my first visit to tour the facility, I was greeted by the friendly front desk person, who provided me with all the details of the new storage facility. In addition to the helpful information about the units, there was a demonstration of storage locker space options set up in their show room. It was so helpful to see the exact sizing of the locker possibilities.  A tour of the facility further impressed me, extremely  clean, several carts for use,  available drive in parking spots, multiple elevators, and well lite hallways. Extra details that made XYZ storage an easy choice included, I could us my own lock, make use of the fully stocked store in the lobby,  cameras that monitor the hallways and elevators, a phone app to open and close the door, no deposit, month to month cycle (not 4 weeks cycles) which saves the cost of a month over a year and the ability to cancel at anytime without penalty.

They are are not open 24 hours but there hours are very reasonable. At the time of writing this there moving truck was not available to use or rent. If that is something you are counting on I would call ahead.
Overall, my experience with XYZ storage has been excellent, a seamless and easy storage solution.  With so many options available I thought it was important to write a review about my experience and why I chose this storage facility over ones that where closer in proximity to me.",2020-03-15 21:49:07,5,google,PLflon70@gmail.com,calvinslife1,toronto-downtown

"I visit this location for Uhaul rentals and am beyond happy with my service each time. By far the BEST location for Uhaul equipment in the entire city. It is easy to get in contact with the staff for inventory confirmations or to book reservations, and the equipment itself is in great shape. Not to mention each and every staff member I've spoken to has been extremely friendly.
If I HAD to note something to be improved it would be possibly to increase the number of staff working at the front desk, but even with that being said the wait time is very minimal (plus they kindly offer you snacks and beverages while you wait!)
To top it all off, this location offers after-hour drop-offs of trailers which relieves a lot of stress when renting.

"Setup of my lease was straightforward. The XYZ staff at Eastern Avenue in Toronto are terrific, well informed and engaged with their customers. The storage unit was prepped properly - clean floor, cleanly finished walls (no bolt heads, welds or sharp edges that cause problems in other storage facilities,  and rollup door operating smoothly. The drive-in area is well maintained and always kept clear - nothing in the way to impede access. There are usually always handcarts available unless the location is unusually busy but even then the wait for a cart is brief. Staff is alway around to answer questions. The on-site shop is very handy and fully stocked with packing tape, pads, boxes, cleaning supplies and other useful things at market prices.

Impeccably clean, secure, very well-maintained. All the units are drive-ups, which is an extreme convenience. Most places charge extra for that convenience, but this location's prices were actually *lower* than all the other competitors I surveyed.

Management
The clean, professional way the place is run is thanks to alex, the facility manager. He is highly efficient while still radiating kindness and good humor. No high-pressure tactics that make you feel uncomfortable, just smooth, efficient service with a great attitude. Things are done promptly, on time, with perfect follow-through.

"This is a wonderful location!  Clean.  Well lit.  Secure, 24 hour access!
The staff are extremely friendly and helpful.  When I first got my locker I had no clue about the process at all; literally, I knew nothing regarding the size I'd need, heated or not, etc.  The staff gave me a full tour and recommended a locker that was just big enough to fit my belongings.  Bottom line:  they didn't try to sell me something I did not need.  They were able to discuss my options with me and provide decent pricing!!  Honestly, this is the best experience I've had with renting a storage unit, even if it is my first :o)

My first time trying to access my locker was after hours; they even have an emergency help line you can call if you have any issues during non-business hours.  So helpful!!!

My ONLY critique would be that there is no option to pay your monthly rent online or by phone (Visa).  You can give post dated cheques which is OK but an online payment option like PayPal or adding them as a payee to my online banking would make life that much easier.  If it wasn't for this I would rate 5 stars.",2016-09-07 16:05:36,4,google,RSlamj48@gmail.com,Tiffany Foster,scarborough

"This is a fantastic facility with very friendly staff. The area is well maintained, clean, and not too busy. The staff is always there to answer questions and make storing your items an easy and enjoyable experience. The only thing that doesn't make this a 5 star rating is that you can only access your unit if the facility is open - it is not 24 hour access.

I have used several storage facilities in the GTA and this by far is the best. They have constant communication through email. Their customer care in person is great.

The fact that you can drive straight into the facility is amazing. It’s convenient  and safe. I was offered coffee and water each time I went in. Lots of trolleys available.

"Hi Lela and Staff--
Many thanks for all your help over 2 years in my big locker and now with my compact locker!  One thing that has been a challenge is the lack of carts.  When I first moved in, there were nice yellow carts everywhere for customers to use.  Then they disappeared, and I understand they were stolen or hoarded in peoples' lockers, but they all seemed to disappear overnight.  Too bad, whatever the reason, but maybe XYZ could come up with a better way to lend carts than to take one's drivers' license.  Special thanks to the maintenance man who helped me today in the frigid cold to use the dumpsters outside.

"I have rented cargo vans and trucks from All Canadian Self-Storage at least a half-dozen times over the recent years.  The staff was professional and pleasant during each and every time.  They have become my go-to place whenever I need a moving van.

I recently needed to rent a storage locker for a few months.  True to form, the staff walked me through my options and the costs involved clearly so that there was no potential for misunderstanding.  They also explained that I always had the option to change to a locker of a different size if necessary.  Again, they were a pleasure to deal with.

If there was any area I would like to see an improvement, it is relating to the access hours.  The storage facility is open only during their business hours of 8-7pm Mon - Fri, and 9-5pm Sa & Su.

I was so happy with their service that I returned later in the day to buy packing supplies, even though I hadn't been planning to.  Alex remembered my name, helped me with my purchase, and even carried my boxes to the door.
I highly recommend All Canadian Self-Storage (Etobicoke). It's a clean facility and the service is exceptional.

Once we came in, he friendly asked us if we needed water, coffee, or take a rest before the big move. Without his support, it would have been much harder for us to get all the work done. Also, he is a good salesman. We agreed to pay a year in full because of his sale pitch. Great staff and wonderful person to have in any company.

"During my experience with All Canadian Storage in renting a truck for my move I found the service and staff to be very helpful and supportive.  They ensured my vehicle was ready and available at the time I needed it.  I have dealt with local uhaul dealers and found them to me about as reliable as the weather man's report.  This is not the case with All Canadian and I will be using them for all truck rental and storage needs moving forward.  Thank you for the device, the smiles and laughs and the good coffee :)

"I'll start off by saying I almost wasn't able to rent here because at the time, like many other buisnesses, the person who had answered the phone at the time tried to turn me away for not having a credit card, despite cash being an option. So if you can pay the bills in cash and you absolutely do not have access to a credit card then insist on cash, It is a part of thier policy and as long as you're honest and explain your situation to them it's likely they'll let you rent. The people I talked to were very understanding!

That being said, my service experience has been great! it was little higher priced than I was initially told, but it was still affordable. The staff explained thier terms to me in a clear and easy to understand way, and they've been kind and helpful! Even going beyond the mile at times!

"***Update****
The manager, Rehan, personally contacted me after seeing this review and apologized for my experience. He did what he could to rectify the situation. I am leaving the review up since it was a terrible experience but it was very nice to speak with a manager who seriously cares about his customers. I would consider giving them a chance in the future.
***************

Short story: They close whenever they feel like it. Moving is stressful enough without poor customer service and hours.

Long story: I decided on All Canadian Self Storage based on online reviews and I regret it completely. First off they messed up my Uhaul reservation by booking it at 9am when I requested 2pm. Once I finally got that figured out, I had only a few hours to move. I raced to get the last load there and was met at the back door by a female employee who told me they had to close early because of an appointment that Alex had. I pleaded to give me 5 minutes and she said it was too late, that he was gone. I raced to the front office to see Alex counting money. I again pleaded and he reluctantly agreed to give me 3 minutes.

The next time I went there to pick up some stuff at 3pm, I was told by Alex that I was trespassing by parking my car there. Confused, I said I was a customer and he said they were closed...2 hours early. He said it was managements decision. I had enough. I rented a Uhaul from another company the next day and got my stuff out of there. Not once was I apologized to or offered a solution.

Save the headache and go to one of the many other storage places that offer MUCH better hours and customer service.",2014-12-20 23:37:18,3,google,SNmaei88@gmail.com,David Myers,etobicoke
"Alex was very friendly and it was overall very easy to get around. Unloading directly into a freight elevator from our rental truck to get up to my storage unit really made this experience incredible for me.

Overall a great experience and would easily suggest it to anyone.",2014-12-15 19:52:53,4,google,UDhdla50@gmail.com,Iskender Piyale-Sheard,etobicoke

"Customer service is very helpful and kind. Sometimes is a bit slow during peak periods when multiple customers require assistance, but this is understandable. When you are moving your storage in there are dollies available and a big freight elevator to move all your stuff in less trips. Uhaul renting is very convenient as well",2014-07-20 22:50:36,4,google,OGppyu46@gmail.com,Jenny Alley,etobicoke
"I recently rented a unit from ACSS Lakeshore location, and I must admit I did not even know how or where to begin my search. I spoke to Alex over the phone and he was able to thoroughly explain everything that I needed to know. He even booked a U-Haul truck for my move over the phone, so all I had to do was to just pick up my truck from their location, go back to their location and put my furniture in to my unit.  He had also put aside a dolly for me when I arrived.
If you are looking for a storage space, all you have to do is give them a call and you  will be amazed by the level of customer service you will receive. Pro-rated to the day, no admin fee, no deposit, no first and last.
Many thanks to all the staff at ACSS for all your help. Keep up the excellent work.

My experience has always been a positive one.I remember, I walked in one day to make a payment for my storage locker and there systems were down. I was paying by cash, so they put my payment aside, but reassured me that as soon as the system was back up they would put through my payment and send me a confirmation email. True to there word, they send me a confirmation email, but what really struck me with this encounter was that they also gave me a business card with a name of a contact person in case I had any issues with the payment going through.

which was never told to me  via email or telephonic conversation and I left with a bitter sad experience. Seems like the moment my excellent Review was sent customer service disappeared!

It appears that the management differs in the rates charged and each one sends an email for non-existent payments at times, Andrew was rude and my hard earned money seems wasted over here.

"Good Location.

Good range of Product.

Weirdly poor  customer service. When they opened I was told that I needed to wait as they were primarily a storage business, not a u-haul rental business, so they had to finish their storage business before they could serve  me. I was waned that this could take up to an hour. I was the only customer in the office.

Then they said that I could return the trailer any time, even if no one was in the office, which I did. Very convenient. However, they charged me for 2 extra days as I surmise that they failed to check-in the trailer on the morning it arrived and all the next day. An over charge of $78 on a $44 fee. It took me 3 phone calls to straighten out the problem.

"I went this place to rent a big size U haul truck. After lining up behind other customers, they noticed me waiting and in 30sec. got to start booking. I left email and cell phone number, after a couple of hours email confirmation. I read reviews of other horror stories, when on your day of moving the truck is not available; so it seems too easy here, so I checked twice if everything is OK with my booked date, the staff confirmed.
Still a bit skeptical, on my booked date I showed up (20 min late) and everything went smoothly, I got the U haul truck that I asked for. The charges were less than what they estimated initially, ............so I am really happy with this place, and would use it again.

I actually used their U haul trucks for my friends moving several times, but I never booked or payed, just drove their rental U haul trucks. Last week was first time I was moving, no problems at all. Thanks",2015-10-02 03:15:17,5,google,KVhkkg86@gmail.com,Vlatko Jordanov,toronto-midtown

"(Now four years after I wrote this review in 2015 the manager recently contacted me to let me know that they have fixed many of the issues that earned it a two star review from me. I have bumped my rating up to 3 stars mostly because they installed an elevator so you won't have to haul boxes up and down stairs like I did).

HOURS - Have you looked at their site? Did you notice how they don't post their hours prominently? That's because it closes at 7 p.m. on weekdays, and 5 p.m. (FIVE!) on weekends. (edit: the manager says that after hours access may be possible)

GETTING WET - There is a nice little garden in the front of the building. I began to resent that garden after the time that I arrived hauling a heavy suitcase and found that a sprinkler had been setup spraying across the only ramp up to the main entrance, forcing me to get soaked on my way in. (Did I mention that they don't care about their customers, or at least not as much as their sunflowers?)

PARTIES - I once had problems accessing my unit because access to the storage units was going to be cut off early that night because there was going to be some kind of political gala held in the garage area of the building. (Why?!) Shamefully, there was no email warning about this. (The manager says that although they continue to host parties here - something you don't have to worry about at most STORAGE FACILITIES - that customers will be warned about early closures).

DRIVING - If you are driving there from the north, it is very difficult to turn into their parking lot.

Finally, those storage units aren't sealed at the top, so anyone with a ladder could easily access the contents of your unit.",2015-08-02 04:30:34,3,google,QAuesy90@gmail.com,Paul Wuertz,toronto-midtown

The ladies at the counter may not always be very patient explaining the rental contract, but are OK for such a place. The location works very well for me. I like there is plenty of space to manoeuvre the rented truck and plenty of parking for your own car. There is also a gas station literally 50 meters away from the facility so it is easy to add fuel when you return the truck.

"My experience with All-Canadian Self-Storage this time around (June 13, 2015) was flawless as it was the other 2 or 3 times I used their services.

I called to reserve a moving van the week before, gave my information and told them what time I wanted to pick up the van. When I arrived at the property at the appointed date and time, I was greeted by friendly staff and invited to share their oatmeal raising cookies (not a usual occurrence, I imagine, but nice nonetheless.)

I gave the woman at the desk (apologies, I forgot her name, but she was very nice and courteous) and had to wait about 5 minutes to get my key to the van. Then we went outside together for the visual inspection.

The inside of the van was spotless and aside from some minor scuffs on the bumpers, in very good shape. The van drove very smoothly and we had no problems. We didn't have to go very far, but as I said, everything went very smoothly.

When I returned the van, the office was still open, and I returned the keys to the same lady who had checked me in. She gave me an updated estimate of the cost based on my odometer readout and when I finally got the bill (that same day) the amounts matched to the penny.

As I said, I have used All Canadian Self-Storage for my UHaul rentals before and will continue to make them my first point of contact for future moving needs. If the manager is reading this review, you should be very proud of your employees.

Obviously nobody is perfect, but I am wracking my brain trying to come up with some way to improve on. The only thing I can think of is that I would have preferred chocolate chip over oatmeal cookies, but I recognize those cookies weren't for me.",2015-06-17 15:41:45,5,google,NSsiuu07@gmail.com,David Fenicky,toronto-midtown

After I got the final bill (and charged a higher amount than what I was initially told), I called in twice to complain. I was told someone would call me back and but that never happened. Now I am contacting the head office for UHaul. EXTREMELY POOR CUSTOMER SERVICE.

Also, the van interior was dirty when I rented it (I forgot to check back there), and I am supposed to return it back clean for them??!?

To nitpick, I'd said they are under staffed as it took the very delightful and pleasant Maria a while to get me setup with a storage unit as she was juggling the phones, new and existing storage unit customers, and UHaul concerns.

Pros: Trucks are clean and ready to go. Pick up and return are expedite. Prices are fair.

Cons: They don't give you the tank full, but apparently always at 7/8 capacity only (why?). That's a nuisance as you have to estimate how much gas you need to put to return at the same level. Also, once they didn't have dollies for rent, even though I had reserved two of them with great advance.

"The truck wasn't available at the time booked, staff claimed they couldn't find the reservation even when my sister gave them the reservation number UHaul had sent us. She left and came all the way downtown and we booked alternative trucks. We were tight on time, and pretty stressed/desperate because I have a sprained ankle, and our moving helper friends all needed to leave by a certain time (4 hours after we were planning to get the truck), plus our elevators were booked only for a specific time. Then we got a call saying the truck was there after all, so my sister drove all the way back in rush hour traffic to get the truck and bring it back downtown. Because of the delay and subsequent lack of people power in the evening, my sister and a friend had to move things until 11:30 pm alone. She was also not treated very kindly or professionally when the truck was not there.

I have been renting U-Haul equipment from All Canadian Self Storage for a few years now and they have always delivered excellent service from efficient and friendly staff and a variety of rental equipment to fit my needs.  Easily accessible to the communities of Leaside and Thorncliffe Park there is no better place rent moving equipment.

"When I first found All Canadian Self Storage using my Google map app; I realized they were the cheapest out of about 5 other known companies that I called for pricing. At first I was a little skeptical about the service and security that would be provided. However, upon my first arrival and every other time thereafter I was always greeted with a smile by a great staff that were not only willing to assist me but also were knowledgeable in the questions that I had. I have had my items in storage for about a year now and have never had any security issues nor heard of any from any of the other unit renters that I have met while at the lockers. For a first time storage renter All Canadian Self Storage has made this experience a stress free one. Thanks!!",2013-08-01 05:52:00,5,google,XHvwro09@gmail.com,M H,scarborough

"I had never used a storage facility before and when I decided to put my furniture etc in storage I was a bit apprehensive. I lived in the same community where All Canadian Storage is located and I had passed by many times, so I decided to drop by and get some information. I met with Christine and she was awesome, she answered all my questions, put me in a golf card and drove me to the unit which was clean and she offered specials that were on and provided information that took my worry away about storage. I ended up purchasing my boxes and other storage supplies from the store and on the day of my move in it was smooth and seamless. I am really happy because I have the ability to go in and check on my things whenever I want with their 24hr access!

"I have never rented a storage space before, but I have helped my friends put there things in and take them out of other storage rooms. So I asked my sister to help me find a storage center. She then told me about ""Canadian Self Storage"" as she was calling to find out pricing, I  was also looking on Google and ""Canadian Self Storage"" company as the first link on Google that pulled up for ""cheap storage in Scarborough"" ...... So my mother and I decided to go. When we arrived we meet with Milan, he was very polite, and helpful in showing us our best options. Milan showed us a few units, and all of them were clean, and very good sizes. We also met Johnny, he was very polite and helpful in the process of getting our 2 units. The prices are great, and exactly what we were looking for. The customer service we received is excellent, they are friendly, polite, helpful, and assisted us with all the questions we had. I am a customer service representative myself and the service we received there is the best from any experience I've had with my friends when going to their storage companies. I would gladly recommend this company to other family and friends.

"I had occassion to use the mobile service when moving from brampton to markham - the customer service agent was great - he explained how this service work, the timeline and cost - he even went as far to give me tips on how to use the container to maximize my content storage.  Just like he explained I was able to pack way more that I could imagine.  They were prompt with the pick-up and when I wanted it delivered were prompted as well.  The driver even assisted me with some of the unloading - this was the smoothest move I ever had and the price remained just as I was quoted - I was pleasantly surprized that the price did not jump like when you hirer movers...I will use them again and will tell anyone who is moving and could use this service.
One more thing - the internal staff is excellent - they are knowledgable, courteous and always have a smile for you.  The customer service manager is the most patience I have come across in public facing service.

When a family crisis erupted while I was switching from one unit to another, they were memorably kind and helpful -- and tactful, too.
 I have had extremely negative experiences with unscrupulous storage places back back home. I can and do recommend the All canadian self storage drive thru storage facility on Laird .. It's clean, heated andthe high end security is great.",2013-02-09 23:45:00,5,OPIO,fatimadelrey19@gmail.com,fatima777,toronto-midtown
"I've had so many bad experiences with storage units, it's nice to trust my belongings are in safe hands, and out of any harm. They really are a quality company, and their prices are amazing, they actually take time to make sure you're happy with their services.

"I called in a month before to book a 5x10 unit and was told that as their contracts are monthly that I need call back closer to my move date (approx a week before). I called in 6 days before my move and when I did was informed that they only had 5x10 available on the second floor and they did not have an elevator. I asked if the stairs were your normal 2 flight steps and was told that they weren't bad and I would be okay to move my couches, bed etc up them. So I booked.
It was fantastic that they had uhaul rentals right there. It got rid of the hassle. The issue was that it was my first time at this location and there wasn't a lot of information given to me or explanation and I was hurried out of the door. My gas tank wasn't full like they said it would be and informed them when I got back only to find out that someone should've gone out with me to check the milage and gas before I left. I haven't been charged extra yet for that but we will see.
The stairs were high and not easy to get up. I parked around the side door because I was being yelled at for blocking access in their drive in area and got frustrated because that is where an employee told me to park.
Taking all my furniture up the stairs was not fun. I am not the strongest person and have a bad back so stairs were a disaster but there was no other choice.

The price is right. After I moved the staff gave me more information and were understanding in general about everything. The price, location, ease of uhaul rental and hours were what drew me to this place. If I had a unit on the main floor this would be a 5/5 review but I feel a bit cheated with the second floor being such a hassle and the confusion over the truck rental but in the end it all worked out.",2012-07-23 18:05:01,4,google,GYxqya90@gmail.com,Shannon Lintott,toronto-midtown

EVERY question, or anything I needed to know or see sizes of the units and making the best choice to pick a storage unit that would accomidate my needs was well organzied. Christine drove me around the location finding exactly which unit would best suit me, Cheryl went over every single detail in terms of pricing and options and what to do as my stay progressed with BEECHGROVE location. THEY ARE TRULY AMAZING AND TAKE EXTREME CARE OF YOU :)",2012-07-17 21:25:43,5,N49,C.RICCIOLINA@HOTMAIL.COM,RICCIOLINA,scarborough

24hr access is a feature that many other storage units don't have. Great Customer service and clean units.  Johnny and Christine were great,2012-07-11 11:02:56,5,google,XNvxpb00@gmail.com,Eric Daw,scarborough
"I have now used All-Canadian Self Storage on two occasions, and I am completely satisfied with them. The employes are courteous, good-natured, and unfailingly patient and helpful; the storage facility is clean and well-lit, and one can drive a car right up to the corridor where one's locker is; their prices are very reasonable, including for packing materials and for disposal of unwanted items (in my case, an old rug and dresser). I felt they went out of their way to treat me right, on prices and everything else.",2012-07-05 20:24:12,5,google,MXfeek80@gmail.com,George Logan,toronto-midtown
"I have been a client at the All Canadian Self Storage facility for over 2 months now and it has been spectacular! I needed to find a storage unit without coming to see them, so I called this business and received spectacular customer service over the phone! A gentleman named Johnny helped me out, gave me all of the details I needed, quotes, and fantastic, affordable suggestions. Because I needed to potentially load my unit from a moving truck after office hours, I was given details and special accommodations to meet my needs.
When I came to check out where my unit was and get the lock about a week before, the owner and a female service representative were very kind to me and even let me lock up my unit in advance for free!! I even got to drop off a few small items early!!
Another great thing about this storage facility is that it has 24 hour entry with a keycard for access. It's gated and completely secure. And the office hours are pretty great too with lots of help when you need it.
I would definitely recommend this business to anyone looking for temporary or long-term storage. They have units of all shapes and sizes for awesome prices.

"I just had to suddenly move provinces alone in the middle of the pandemic with 1 week notice, which was honestly no small feat. XYZ storage was indispensable to me!   Firstly, the rates are very reasonable for storage here, but I think the staff are what really set this place apart!  Over the phone, Sarah helped me figure out all of the logistics of getting my things to the facility: from what size unit was right for me, to helping me find reliable movers, and making sure I had the packing supplies I needed in a timely fashion. Being able to talk care of those three things in more or less one phone call was a DREAM. She was extremely patient with my excessive questions, and handled the logistic of my move from start to finish.   Though I didn’t get the names of the women working at the facility when I went in on May 29th and 30th, I can honestly say they were an absolute delight as well. Helpful, welcoming, and as a bonus funny.  I was really intimidated by this whole moving process, as I have never moved alone without a room mate or a family member, and I am SO THANKFUL for these people. They made the whole experience as stress free as moving could possibly be! Couldn’t recomend this place enough.

"Terrible service. My fiancé called at 6pm and was told about a promotion giving customers 50% off for the first three months of storage fees. He told the woman on the phone he would be there in 20 minutes. When he arrived it was a half hour before closing and the woman he spoke with was not at the front counter. Instead he was met by an employee who was huffing and puffing and had the nerve to say to him if he wants a unit he should come in earlier. He stated to her that they don't close for another half hour. Again huffing and puffing and very reluctantly she tells him fine she will do it but she will require ID, a lock, a credit card etc. He told her that he was told he could buy a lock and he has all of his ID and credit cards on hand. She then tells him that because it is the 7th of the month that she cannot give him the promotion so he would have to pay $299 for the first month instead of the $149 he was quoted on the phone. He asks her why was he told otherwise on the phone? No response. It makes ABSOLUTELY no sense to charge customers full price because they haven't used your service from the 1st of the month. It actually benefits you if a customer comes in later on in the month ie. The 7th, 14th, 28th and is still willing to pay and sign up for three months. Needless to say he left and we will not be using your services nor will we recommend your services to anyone. Terrible customer service.",2020-04-07 23:01:14,1,google,LMwmbx40@gmail.com,R A,toronto-west
Rented a storage room for the first time from here on April 5th. Online process went smoothly and we got a free month rent but opted for the 3 months 50%. I like that no commitment is needed.

Great storage facility. They give you a pin to use to get in and out of the building. You enter at the front and then exit at the back at a separate entrance. Two elevators to get upstairs. Not enough of those dollies to move your items around. Kind of isolated inside so I don't go by myself at night but they do have cameras but no emergency button that I've seen. One time when exiting someone pulled in as I left so not very secure.,2019-09-09 19:34:52,4,google,YKktlw54@gmail.com,Keshia,toronto-west
"I have been renting a small locker at the Laird location for four years. Six months ago they raised my rent with no notification, I just found out through the bill. I called and they said it would be the only increase for a year. I just got another increase and they took out the money a day early on August 31st not September 1st. I called and spoke to Amed. He said the company decides who to increase the rent on, it is at their discretion. I asked if my gender would make them increase the rent and Amed laughed.",2019-09-08 23:55:43,1,google,CKaane92@gmail.com,Joe,toronto-west

"Experienced a great deal of frustration with their customer care and website.  We loaded our items into our storage unit on August 26 and dealt with paperwork at their Weston location with Lela.  I stressed the fact that we were exhausted after our long move and to make sure to explain things clearly and she assured me that everything would be taken care of.    A few days later I receive a call stating that I had to pay insurance on the unit.  ??    Why wasn't I told this during the initial meeting so that I could have paid it on the spot?  Instead I had to use their online system which unbeknown to me, was sending emails to my spam folder.   After 4 or 5 calls to XYZ,   the problem still was not resolved.  When I called AGAIN on the afternoon of September 4, Natasha said she would call me right back with a solution after speaking with her manager.  It is now September 5 , 11:57am and there has been NO CALL BACK.    It was only a few minutes ago when my partner figured out that since the business has changed its name from Canada storage to XYZ, their email was being re-routed to my spam account, that I was able to access the website and pay for the insurance.  And all before the ""deadline of September 7"" after which I would have surely been charged a late fee and/or cancellation of my storage unit.  Not impressed!",2019-09-05 16:07:46,1,google,GThiwf07@gmail.com,Caroline,toronto-west

"I used ACSS's mobile storage solution. From beginning to end, ACSS was phenomenal providing service. When researching storage options, I called several places, and ACSS seemed the best and had reasonable rates for mobile storage. I was able to easily schedule drop off/pick up at point A and subsequently at point B where we moved. All my belongings in the storage box were in good condition on delivery. The staff at the office were extremely helpful and friendly providing service, and that same great service extended to the drivers too! Mobile is extremely useful if you, like us, need a place to keep your things and you don't want to hire a van twice to move it all yourself. It's storage and moving at the same time!

I'm generally very critical about customer service standards, and hardly come across businesses worth sharing- ACSS is an exception. Every touch point was a positive one. I can't recommend them enough and would use them again for storage needs.",2019-04-15 15:31:09,5,google,UMyqrf65@gmail.com,Adnaan Bhyat,toronto-west

Sarah sent me the contract immediately after our phone call and I had everything signed and sent back to her within minutes. The next day, service was prompt/efficient as my contract was completed/processed prior. I was assigned a top level storage unit, but raised concern that I would not be able to lift my items to put in that unit. The lady looked for a lower unit for me so I could easily slide my belongings in. When coming to remove my belongings, I forgot my keys! This was no issue as they had a nic gentleman (Carlo) cut my lock for me!

I called and once spoke to the manager about the works and she said she would look.  I kept calling back and nothing found.  They suggested that maybe they were thrown out.  I happen to know storage facilities don't just throw things out without checking what is inside.  I then went in and asked to post some notices in case someone had picked it up.  They did let me but when I called a while back apparently they took the notices down a while back. My problem obviously was not their issue.  So I lost what was precious and expensive.

"Like many people using self-storage for the first time, I was expecting a world of hassle. Generally in situations like these I consider myself lucky if I only get yelled at once or twice by a bitter cranky staff member hell-bent on projecting frustrations from his/her personal life because I didn't already know the complete ins and outs of the business of self-storage the very FIRST TIME I'm using it. Thankfully I dug around review sites like Yelp and trusted the power of community evaluations and reviews, because today's experience, on the other hand, redefined and completely exceeded the word ""service"".

Awkwardly stumbling through the main entrance with my loose luggage, I locked eye with Sarah (why eye singular? You'll soon find out), the lovely and charming staff member who immediately tended to me and managed to find out what I needed, albeit with half my face covered by two large wardrobe bags throughout our conversation. She was very understanding, patient, social, agreeable and most importantly, honest. I deeply enjoyed her presence, helpfulness and every second of our conversations.

Soon they suggested I take a load off, temporarily setting my luggage in one corner of the office while they give me a quick tour of the storage unit I was looking to rent. That's when Jessica, the super perky staff, surprised me with a ""would you like tea?"" and still actually handed me a cup of apple cinnamon hot tea even though the hipster-diva in me uncontrollably blurted out ""do you have anything herbal?"". It's safe to say said tea warmed me straight to the heart.

The process was efficient. I received exactly what I set out to get- a clean, safe and secured mini-storage unit. The price was reasonable, and every person in that office was extremely helpful and had bright smiles.

They were a welcoming bunch, each one a friendly individual, and together they were undoubtably a wonderful representation of their company.

I left there blushing by the end, because today I was spoiled by a group of kindhearted people. And you know what? I didn't mind at all :)",2017-02-24 05:44:47,5,google,IYpqfv80@gmail.com,Andy Yu,toronto-west

"ACSS at Weston was excellent and met all our needs.  We greatly appreciated the ability to drive through and unload and reload in comfortable surroundings.  Having moved from a house in Ottawa to  a Condo in Toronto we needed three different storage units over the course of a year: first to store what didn't fit into our Condo; second, to store everything when we moved out for three months while the Condo was renovated; and third, to store left overs and our children's items until they could be given away or claimed by the children. The locker prices were reasonable, especially given the convenient location, the  transfer between lockers was easy and the changes in rates for the various lockers were prorated for the transfer months and at the end.  All the staff with whom we dealt were courteous and helpful.  As we were knew to Toronto, we didn't know any local movers.  ACSS Weston recommended Steve at Lift Labour and we ended up using him six times (three times for our children and three times for ourselves).  His service was excellent and  affordable and we sincerely appreciate having received the recommendation. I beleive that it would be hard, if not, impossible to find better storage in Toronto.",2017-02-14 15:58:35,5,google,MMcans43@gmail.com,Robin Ghosh,toronto-west

I had moved the night before and not all of my stuff would fit into my new place, so in desperation I drove to this location with a 15 foot truck filled with a few things. When I called from the Uhaul down the street to see if they had anything, after I explained my situation to Chuddie on the phone she was so welcoming to me. I was tired and stressed out. I walked into the office and she knew who I was and even through she was already with a customer she addressed me right away.  She showed me my unit and exactly how everything worked and then she knew that I did not have anyone to help me lift my box spring so Copeland helped me out and lifted the stuff for me that I could not.

"When I was looking for self-storage help six months back, the last thing I thought I would be doing is writing a Google review about customer service.  We needed temporary storage and had a number of challenges:  the timeline that we originally had was way off, the amount of storage required was vastly underestimated (our fault), our original requirements would change (from storage lockers to storage containers) – suffice it to say, it would have been easy for a storage facility to ‘take advantage’ of our changing and last minute requirements and have a nightmare on our hands – but nothing could be further from the truth.

Annissa and her team (specifically Natasha and Copeland) at the Weston Rd Location, approached our problems as if they were their own, gave us opportunities to more cost effectively use their facilities, and despite some last minute requirements that we had- were able to consult with us in a relaxed and professional manner, making us feel like we were the most important and only clients they had!  Antonio from the Scarborough facility was equally professional and courteous.

The level of assistance and service was far superior then I could have ever imagined, in an industry that I was naïve enough to think was a straightforward commodity.  The team were real professionals, and I would highly recommend them!  Someone has invested in good people and created a culture for service – and it really shows.

The two times I came to All Canadian Self-Storage were good experiences! The first time Juddie showed my sister and I around the facility and answered all our questions. She was very helpful in setting us up to start at a time that was convenient for us and even recommended a really good moving company. The second time I came I was having diofficulty with my lock and Anissa fixed it for me first before I could even ask to buy a replacement from them.

Met with Luke two days later and booked unit - facility was bright and clean.  On the day we moved belongings in there were no carts in sight when we arrived - staff gathered up two carts for us and we were completely unloaded in 30 minutes.  Prior to moving our belongins to our new apartment we decided to employ some help - Luke again was very helpful and gave me the number for Lift Labour - this worked out great.  Steve and his two assistants from Lift Labour met us at the storage unit exactly when they said they would be there - and the move - loading from storage, driving to Yonge and Davisville, and unloading our belongings to the new apartment was completed in 3 hours as estimated.  The price quoted by Lift Labour was the price we paid.

Second time that I went back there Sep 1, all the trucks rent it out, she went backwards again and she found us a track. What I can say. I recommend from the heart this location, you just have to see and compare the service level that you get.

But, the part that blew me away was how incredibly friendly the staff were. Several times in my contact with them they seemed to bend over backwards to make my experience, quick, easy, and even cheaper.

The way they rebate unused time or upgrade you without a hassle (or sales push) if you need more space were signs of this.But, the biggest consistent marker was the genuine care and like they were looking out for my best interest. From the front line staff to the phone help to the janitor/maintanance people.

"I had made a reservation and called ahead to confirm. When I arrived, the customer who had said he would drop off my truck had not done so. The staff were very apologetic, and contacted the customer to entreat him extensively to return the truck. Unfortunately, he never brought the truck in, which was inconvenient for me, but certainly not the fault of the staff, who subsequently did everything in their power to obtain a suitable truck. In the end, they shuffled some things around and I rented a suitable truck from them. In particular, Annissa was on the phone (in fact, using two phones at a time sometimes) from the moment there was a problem, until she got it sorted out.

The staff are very helpful and diligent. My only criticism would be to U-Haul as a company, who I perceived were not very helpful to the staff in assisting me. However, it was the end of the month which is the busiest time, so perhaps this difficulty was atypical from the service usually to be expected.

Great job, and thanks for your efforts. My move worked out well because the staff cared to treat me with respect as a customer, notwithstanding extenuating circumstances beyond their control.",2014-09-28 16:14:30,5,google,BAwhrk86@gmail.com,Alexander Dahl,toronto-west

"I told my friend about an hour after leaving self storage that it was the best customer service i'd ever received. Me and my friend were desperate (and in the midst of moving), and the employee by whom we were served was not only extremely kind and personable but did us a tremendous favor and served us coffee in the morning when we returned the truck. I would recommend All Canadian Self Storage and their Uhaul service to anybody.",2014-09-17 04:11:52,5,google,TOwvud75@gmail.com,Nick Jeffrey,toronto-west

"I rented a storage unit at this location. Most all my dealings were with Diana. AMAZING customer service from everyone! Uhaul on the other hand was terrible. I was moving in and on my last load I jumped out of the back of the van and my keys fell out. Not noticing I shut the door and as the locks all work together I was locked out. No phone, no keys even for my own vehicle, no purse....nothing. This was at midnight in the storage building. After looking everywhere, we couldn't find a public phone. I wandered to the office and the door was ajar so I went to use the office phone. Phoned Diana waking her up and the sweetheart came down to help us out. She stayed for an hour and a half assisting with the calls to Uhaul road side assistance, offering us food and beverage. she was a total life saver. I had to argue with uhaul that my insurance should cover road side even speaking to a manager and they were TERRIBLE to deal with as I am in Canada. One agent was able to assist me properly and dispatched CAA. He said it would be 90Min. Diana loaned us her cell phone before she left and we waited over 2 hrs. No one came. I called back and the next agent was equalling as bad to deal with even stated that the service trip was cancelled. After half hour of negotiating a CAA truck pulls in as a result of the previous agent and it HADNT been cancelled. Uhaul needs WAY better customer service.  She unlocked the door no problems and we were on our way.  I just want to go out and make a point to say that DIANA goes above and beyond for her job and I sincerely hope she is awarded accordingly. If I ever need storage in the future Ill be requesting her specifically. Any dealings I had for the in person Uhaul contact were amazing, it was just the customer service on the phone with Uhaul customer service where the problem existed. I walked in last minute and All Canadian Storage was able to accommodate me with a vehicle. Thank you for your excellent customer service.

These folks are incredible. I can't imagine a storage centre that remembers peoples names and offers the kind of customer service they do. It feels like you're part of a community when you're in the office lobby. The rep even stayed late to let me in after hours when I was in a crunch to store some things.

"It is hard to find businesses that genuinely deserve a 5 star rating and I wish I could give a All Canadian Self Storage at Weston Road something higher than 5 stars.

Few things I liked about the place,

Facility:  The storage site is very clean and well maintained. All equipment that I required to move my stuff from the truck to the storage unit on 2nd floor was available which made it very convenient to unload a 10' feet truck in a matter of couple of hours by myself.  The storage is drive-up, so you don't have to worry about rain/snow while loading/unloading. One of the other things I liked was that you only pay for the days you actually use the storage, there is no need to sign a long-term contract.

Staff: The staff at this storage facility was incredibly friendly and helpful.  Even when it got really busy they would give each customer due attention and make sure all their questions are answered. I interacted with Diana and Annissa at separate occasions and both went beyond my expectations in customer service. From offering coffee / fruits to calling a cab for me when I was ready to leave. Besides that they were also very knowledgeable about the products and services offered at the facility and were able to give me details about the different options available from top of their head.

All in all, I'm very satisfied with the facility and the service and will definitely use All Canadian self Storage as my a first choice for future storage and moving needs.",2014-09-01 14:44:52,5,google,YAxhrk56@gmail.com,Dev Sud,toronto-west
