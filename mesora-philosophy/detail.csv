        <dt>Intermarriage is something which we all must dissuade others from
          committing. The consequences include the cancellation of potential
          Jews, as all children born of Gentile mothers are not Jewish.
        <dt> 
        <dt>The Torah in no way condones intermarriage which is at the very core
          of the current destruction of the Jewish people. We even have many
          protective laws guarding against intermarriage. However, once one has
          intermarried, we must be objective about the new situation - however
          grave. Leaving all emotions aside, we should communicate with those
          intermarried, keeping our relationship strong, perhaps in time they
          will be exposed to ideas, eventually seeing Judaism's tenets as true.
        <dt>Tell them about our site, but not so soon. First, reestablish a
          connection with both of them for now.
        <dt> 
        <dt>All other religions distort ideas regarding true monotheism.
          Intermarriage therefore is a an acceptance of other religions - a
          denial of God's word, and His Oneness. It is an act which denies all
          the principles of the Torah. If one marries a Christian, he goes
          further and he displays an acceptance of idolatry. God gave one
          system, Judaism. Marrying someone from another religion is an
          acceptance of that religion to some degree, and Judaism is intolerant
          of <u>any degree</u> of acceptance of alien notions.
        <dt> 
        <dt>God's word and His Torah are perfect, not to be altered at all, as
          we are commanded not to add or subtract from the Torah, or veer from
          the words of the Rabbis.
